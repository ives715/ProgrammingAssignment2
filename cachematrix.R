## These functions will take in a matrix, cache it produce the inverse.
## It is going to cache the computed inverse so that if it is called a second time
## it doesn't have to waste time re-computing the inverse.

## This function will take in a matrix and cache it.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function will first check if the inverse of the matrix from makeCacheMatrix has already been computed.
## If not, it will re-calculate the inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
